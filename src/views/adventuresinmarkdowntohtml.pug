      h3 Promises galore!
      p In creating this portfolio/resume/personal website, I thought it might be nice to have a system where I could just write a series of individual, self-contained posts in markdown format, and then translate that document to #[a(href="https://pugjs.org/api/getting-started.html") pug]. It turned out to be a little bit more involved than that, since then generation didn’t account for things like links inside of paragraphs or fenced code blocks. There was also plenty of async/await going on behind the scenes in order to make sure that the page didn’t render before the conversion took place.
      p There’s also the possibility that I over-thought/ over-engineered the whole thing and made a real SNAFU of a possibly simplistic matter. But at the time, this seemed to be the most elegant way to achieve what I wanted to do.
      h4 Lets start from the top…
      pre.hljs
        code. 
          router.get("/", async (req, res, next) => {
              let posts = await generateHTML();
      
              res.render("index", {
                  title,
                  now: moment().format("MMMM Do, YYYY"),
                  createdPosts: posts.join("")
              });
          });
      
      p I’m using #[a(href="https://expressjs.com/") express.js] for my web server, and signaling it to render my .pug files as HTML. That await right there is the crux of the whole operation. It outputs a list of inline HTML that I then shove into the home page as links to the individualized pages I render from the markdown.
      pre.hljs
        code. 
          const generateHTML = () => {
              return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
                  glob(
                          path.join(__dirname, "../../public/files/*.md"),
                      async (err, files) => {
                          if (err) {
                              reject(err);
                          }
      
                          const blurb = await readData(files);
                          resolve(blurb);
                      }
                  );
              });
          };
      
      p This returns a promise which then searches my /files directory for any .md files and creates the home page link.
      pre.hljs
        code. 
          const readData = async files => {
              return Promise.all(files.map(file => generateBlurbPromise(file)));
          };
      
      p This then gets all of the blurbs for all of the .md files into one array.
      pre.hljs
        code. 
          const generateBlurbPromise = async file => {
              const data = await readFile(file); // this is just a promise that does IO
              return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
                  let headerRegex = /^#{1}\s((?!#).*)$/gim;
                  let dateRegex = /^#{2}\s((?!#).*)$/gim;
                  let blurbRegex = /^#{3}\s((?!#).*)$/gim;
      
                  let header = (data.match(headerRegex) || []).map(e =>
                      e.replace(headerRegex, "$1")
                  )[0];
                  let date = (data.match(dateRegex) || []).map(e =>
                      e.replace(dateRegex, "$1")
                  )[0];
                  let blurb = (data.match(blurbRegex) || []).map(e =>
                      e.replace(blurbRegex, "$1")
                  )[0];
      
                  let headerCopy = header.replace(/\s|-|\\|\d/gim, "").toLowerCase();
      
                  createWebPage(data, headerCopy);
                  // some stuff that breaks my engine but the blurb gets resolved with more regex
              });
          };
      
      p The actual home page blurb gets resolved up, and the web page gets created in the background. I should probably be using async/await here, too, but I am still a little mistified as to when it’s necessary. I kind of just found a configuration that works and hoped it wasn’t so superfluous. I kind of cheated by using increasing levels of headers and crazy levels of regular expressions, but I mean it works

          ### Promises galore!
      
      p I need this structure at the top of every one of my posts, and I need an extra tab in all of my code fences (I tried making it cleaner, but this works every time so far and is much simpler than the positive-lookbehind nonsense that I would have had to do). I also need a delimiter at the end of any links, but other than that I can just type in plaintext and it gets converted to paragraph tags.
      pre.hljs
        code. 
          const createWebPage = (data, header) => {
              var generated = mdGenerator.render(data);
              var templateString = "extends layout \nblock content \n".length;
              generated = [
                  generated.slice(0, templateString),
                  "  .row\n    .col-md-8.post-container\n",
                  generated.slice(templateString)
                  .replace(/\s\s(h\d)/gim, "      $1")
                  .replace(/\s\s(p)/gmi, '      $1')
              ].join("");
      
              generated = generated.replace(/hljs\n(\s*code)/gm, 'hljs\n    $1');
      
              fs.writeFileSync(`src/views/${header}.pug`, generated);
              router.get(`/${header}`, function(req, res, next) {
                  res.render(header, { title });
              });
          };
      
      p This is the final piece. This creates the webpage and does some regex craziness to fix some of the grey areas that the markdown-to-pug package can’t handle very well. I added the functionality with just-about-boilerplate code, but after about a days worth of work I think my whole system is at a point where I’m pretty proud of it. At least proud enough to just use it for a while and not have to poke at the innards.
